Smriti Singh is a documentary filmmaker and creative practice researcher whose work explores the intersections of gender, diaspora, and participatory storytelling. With over 13 years of industry experience collaborating with organisations like National Geographic, the History Channel, and the United Nations, her films focus on amplifying underrepresented voices through ethical, community-led narratives. She is currently completing a practice-based PhD, using feminist audiovisual methods to reframe how stories are told and who gets to tell them.
