        <p style="font-weight:300;">The project’s digital archive will contain digitised primary materials from the following archives: the 
        Mara Blasetti and 
        Cecilia Mangini archives (held by our partner the Cineteca di Bologna), and the Cecchi D’Amico family archive (including papers of 
        Suso 
        Cecchi D’Amico, Silvia D’Amico, and Caterina D’Amico). Through the project team’s work, these resources will be critically  
        positioned to challenge the dominant narrative of Italian film history. The digital archive will also include material on women 
        found in other archives, photographs, press articles, and videos of oral testimonies collected for this project. These
        will be accompanied by explanatory interventions and study guides for researchers and other users. This open-access repository will 
        allow for new research to emerge in the areas of Italian cinema and culture, production studies, gendered labour, oral history, and 
        other aspects of the film sector and creative industries at large.</p>
