        <h5>The project’s digital archive will contain digitised primary materials from the following archives: the Mara Blasetti and Cecilia Mangini archives (held by our partner the Cineteca di Bologna), and the Cecchi D’Amico family archive (including papers of Suso Cecchi D’Amico, Silvia D’Amico, and Caterina D’Amico). Through the project team’s work, these resources will be critically positioned to challenge the dominant narrative of Italian film history. The digital archive will also include material on women found in other archives, photographs, press articles, and videos of oral testimonies collected for this project. These
will be accompanied by explanatory interventions and study guides for researchers and other users. This open-access repository will allow for new research to emerge in the areas of Italian cinema and culture, production studies, gendered labour, oral history, and other aspects of the film sector and creative industries at large.</h5>
