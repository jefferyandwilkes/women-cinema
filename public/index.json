Though she pursued a degree in History, she soon realized her true passion was cinema. Her mother, Isa Bartalini, was Italy’s first casting director, and she worked with iconic directors like Alessandro Blasetti and Billy Wilder, inspiring Trapani to follow in her footsteps. She began her profession as her mother’s assistant before forging her own career path and establishing Studio t Casting in 1985. While her early work primarily focused on international commercials, it wasn’t long before she transitioned into cinema: her career as an international casting director took off with Gangs of New York, but she also worked on very different productions such as Zoolander 2 (2016) and Mary Magdalene (2018), as well on several television shows such as the Count of Montecristo (2024) and Unwanted (2023).\nTrapani explained that the work of a casting director consists of different phases, from reading the script to the approval of the actors by the director and the producer. She mentioned how the role was once seen as more administrative but now requires a deep understanding of character and human interaction. Additionally, casting directors have now gained more recognition, through specific categories in awards like BAFTAs, the David di Donatello, and the Academy Award for Achievement in Casting. When asked why there is a predominance of women in the role of casting director (almost 80% of the members of both the Italian Union of Casting Directors and the International Casting Directors Association are women), Trapani offered a thought-provoking response. While many might assume it is because at its very beginning casting was perceived as a secretarial task, she believes the real reason lies in the nurturing and accommodating nature of the job, qualities which are typically associated with women. She says it is not perceived as a leadership job, but as a support role. However, if we aim to change the narrative, it must be said that there is significant power in nurturing and being able to satisfy different visions, as well as in reaching a common ground and having the strength to prove your point when you think an actor is the best option for a role. It is a very challenging job that requires patience, empathy, care and the ability to make actors feel comfortable. As a casting director, one must understand different visions, different roles and channel all of those in one single person who will hopefully result in the perfect choice for the role. Furthermore, Trapani explained how the casting director’s role has evolved significantly, especially with the rise of online databases and digital tools. Now, the use of self-tapes is much more common, which allows to cut the costs, but, at the same time, makes the job of the casting director more difficult, because of the amount of material received and of the errors that might arise when actors film themselves on their own phone. Moreover, the job of the casting director often requires the duty to respect inclusivity and diversity. Trapani claimed that a change in the representation of diversity is happening in the Italian film industry, even if at a slower pace than in more progressive countries such as the UK. Despite the challenges, Trapani remains optimistic about the future of casting, particularly when it comes to promoting inclusivity. She believes that the industry is slowly evolving, and the focus on diverse representation will continue to grow, ensuring that future generations of filmmakers and audiences see a broader range of stories and voices on screen, reflecting the world we live in today.

Depending on the type of archive, you will find more or less personal objects and documents, but all of them tell a story, an individual’s story. Sometimes this story is strongly related to his or her work, but in some instances it is more personal. For this reason, it is with a sort of reverential respect, almost on tiptoe, that I inspect and rummage into someone’s papers.\nMy last experience with personal archives concerns two women that played a significant role in the history of Italian cinema: Cecilia Mangini and Mara Blasetti, whose collections are held at the Cineteca of Bologna. As part of my work within the Women in Italian Film Production project, my task was to examine their archives and select materials for digitalization. The materials were selected with the aim of showing these women’s lives and work behind the scenes, while also revealing how they viewed and remembered their work. What did they do? How did they work? How did they consider their work? Did they value what they did? Did they consider it worthy of being taken as a model by future generations? With all these questions in mind, I started searching and researching.\nWhat I found were two worlds, two lives, two women who did their job with passion and dedication. Mangini’s archive (that is actually the Mangini-Del Fra collection, and includes the work she did with her husband) is bigger than Blasetti’s, and it shows more aspects of the private sphere, such as letters exchanged with her husband in which both archival research and moments of their personal lives are discussed. The archive collects many documents related to her husband’s work, but fortunately also many papers and materials related to hers - which gives us a chance to get to know her and her work behind the camera.\nBlasetti’s archive, on the contrary, collects a lot of working materials, brochures, working plans, and so on. At first glance, this seems a much more professional archive. However, it hides something very personal, which reveals Blasetti’s personality: it contains many of her planners, in which she noted down a great deal of information about her life. She was an obsessive writer, and used to take notes of every event, from a simple breakfast with a friend to a working lunch with a colleague. Mangini’s and Blasetti’s archives are so different and so alike at the same time. They both were created and organised by their owners, and reveal some aspects of these female professionals’ personalities. They are not only a testimony of their work, but also a representation of themselves. Thanks to these archives, I had the opportunity to meet a director and photographer - Mangini - and a production supervisor - Blasetti - and, above all, two women who dedicated a significant part of themselves to Italian cinema.\nClara Giannini\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0dd232a3b2d526addb7529c28e9cc69","permalink":"https://example.com/post/archival-experiences/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/archival-experiences/","section":"post","summary":"Entering a personal archive means gaining access to someone’s life, meeting someone unknown before and, in a certain sense, invading a personal space.

In my career I’ve interviewed many film professionals, mostly directors, but the Women in Italian Film Production project was such a different experience for me.For the project, with my colleagues Daniela Treveri Gennari and Silvia Dibeltulo, I conducted thirty-eight interviews with female film professionals working in the Italian film industry.\nAll the interviewees were asked a series of standardized questions, which, although it may seem like a boring practice, is an effective method to detect trends, similarities and differences in their experiences. Asking the right questions in a confidential environment is the key to understanding their personality and life choices. The group of people we spoke to is composed of producers, heads of production, distributors, VFX artists, costume designers, casting directors, continuity supervisors, assistant directors: all below- the-line female workers . Despite their different roles, the ways in which they describe their work and experience are often similar.\nI was struck by how often the following topics recur in their testimonies:\nFate: most of them started to work in the film industry by chance, without having planned it. Some of them sent a last-minute application for the Italian National School of Cinema (CSC), while not being entirely confident that they would be successful in their attempt. Passion: they smile a lot while talking about their work. It looks like it’s one of the most important things in their life, if not the most important one. Professionalism: all these women are very independent, since they have built their careers on their own. They want to be recognized for the quality of their work, just like their male colleagues are. Fun: working on set is tiring and stressful, because of long shifts and psychological pressure, but this doesn’t matter, as the upside is that they have a lot of fun. According to their statements, working in the film industry is a source of unique experiences, interesting encounters, and unforgettable moments of collective fun. Family: they mean the family that gets created while shooting a film, when 100 to 200 people strive together towards a creative goal. This kind of partnership can be very powerful and sometimes almost more important than your own family. For some of these women the family built on set is the family they choose. The photo chosen for this blog post was taken during one of the interviews. It is a motto adopted by one of our interviewees that means “Ignore your responsibilities. Pretend to be dead.” It is a way out that women should practice more, as animals do, instead of always being ready and present.\nBarbara Corsi\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8809f8dbb63ff10ac4926d24f886e780","permalink":"https://example.com/post/interviews/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/interviews/","section":"post","summary":"I’ve been a journalist for twenty-five years.
